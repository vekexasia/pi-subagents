# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [0.7.0] - 2026-02-09

### Added
- **Agents Manager overlay** — browse, view, edit, create, and delete agent definitions from a TUI opened via `Ctrl+Shift+A` or the `/agents` command
  - List screen with search/filter, scope badges (user/project), chain badges
  - Detail screen showing resolved prompt, recent runs, all frontmatter fields
  - Edit screen with field-by-field editing, model picker, skill picker, thinking picker, full-screen prompt editor
  - Create from templates (Blank, Scout, Planner, Implementer, Code Reviewer, Blank Chain)
  - Delete with confirmation
  - Launch directly from overlay with task input and skip-clarify toggle (`Tab`)
- **Chain files** — `.chain.md` files define reusable multi-step chains with YAML-style frontmatter per step, stored alongside agent `.md` files
  - Chain serializer with round-trip parse/serialize fidelity
  - Three-state config semantics: `undefined` (inherit), value (override), `false` (disable)
  - Chain detail screen with flow visualization and dependency map
  - Chain edit screen (raw file editing)
  - Create new chains from the template picker or save from the chain-clarify TUI (`W`)
- **Save overrides from clarify TUI** — press `S` to persist model/output/reads/skills/progress overrides back to the agent's frontmatter file, or `W` (chain mode) to save the full chain configuration as a `.chain.md` file
- **Multi-select and parallel from overlay** — select agents with `Tab`, then `Ctrl+R` for sequential chain or `Ctrl+P` to open the parallel builder
  - Parallel builder: add same agent multiple times, set per-slot task overrides, shared task input
  - Progressive footer: 0 selected (default hints), 1 selected (`[ctrl+r] run [ctrl+p] parallel`), 2+ selected (`[ctrl+r] chain [ctrl+p] parallel`)
  - Selection count indicator in footer
- **Slash commands with per-step tasks** — `/run`, `/chain`, and `/parallel` execute subagents with full live progress rendering and tab-completion. Results are sent to the conversation for the LLM to discuss.
  - Per-step tasks with quotes: `/chain scout "scan code" -> planner "analyze auth"`
  - Per-step tasks for parallel: `/parallel scanner "find bugs" -> reviewer "check style"`
  - `--` delimiter also supported: `/chain scout -- scan code -> planner -- analyze auth`
  - Shared task (no `->`): `/chain scout planner -- shared task`
  - Tab completion for agent names, aware of task sections (quotes and `--`)
  - Inline per-step config: `/chain scout[output=ctx.md] "scan code" -> planner[reads=ctx.md] "analyze auth"`
  - Supported keys: `output`, `reads` (`+` separates files), `model`, `skills`, `progress`
  - Works on all three commands: `/run agent[key=val]`, `/chain`, `/parallel`
- **Run history** — per-agent JSONL recording of task, exit code, duration, timestamp
  - Recent runs shown on agent detail screen (last 5)
  - Lazy JSONL rotation (keeps last 1000 entries)
- **Thinking level as first-class agent field** — `thinking` frontmatter field (off, minimal, low, medium, high, xhigh) editable in the Agents Manager
  - Picker with arrow key navigation and level descriptions
  - At runtime, appended as `:level` suffix to the model string
  - Existing suffix detection prevents double-application
  - Displayed on agent detail screen

### Fixed
- **Parallel live progress** — top-level parallel execution (`tasks: [...]`) now shows live progress for all concurrent tasks. Each task's `onUpdate` updates its slot in a shared array and emits a merged view, so the renderer can display per-task status, current tools, recent output, and timing in real time. Previously only showed results after all tasks completed.
- **Slash commands frozen with no progress** — `/run`, `/chain`, and `/parallel` called `runSync`/`executeChain` directly, bypassing the tool framework. No `onUpdate` meant zero live progress, and `await`-ing execution blocked the command handler, making inputs unresponsive. Now all three route through `sendToolCall` → LLM → tool handler, getting full live progress rendering and responsive input for free.
- **`/run` model override silently dropped** — `/run scout[model=gpt-4o] task` now correctly passes the model through to the tool handler. Added `model` field to the tool schema for single-agent runs.
- **Quoted tasks with `--` inside split incorrectly** — the segment parser now checks for quoted strings before the `--` delimiter, so tasks like `scout "analyze login -- flow"` parse correctly instead of splitting on the embedded ` -- `.
- **Chain first-step validation in per-step mode** — `/chain scout -> planner "task"` now correctly errors instead of silently assigning planner's task to scout. The first step must have its own task when using `->` syntax.
- **Thinking level ignored in async mode** — `async-execution.ts` now applies thinking suffix to the model string before serializing to the runner, matching sync behavior
- **Step-level model override ignored in async mode** — `executeAsyncChain` now uses `step.model ?? agent.model` as the base for thinking suffix, matching the sync path in `chain-execution.ts`
- **mcpDirectTools not set in async mode** — `subagent-runner.ts` now sets `MCP_DIRECT_TOOLS` env var per step, matching the sync path in `execution.ts`
- **`{task}` double-corruption in saved chain launches** — stopped pre-replacing `{task}` in the overlay launch path; raw user task passed as top-level param to `executeChain()`, which uses `params.task` for `originalTask`
- **Agent serializer `skill` normalization** — `normalizedField` now maps `"skill"` to `"skills"` on the write path
- **Clarify toggle determinism** — all four ManagerResult paths (single, chain, saved chain, parallel) now use deterministic JSON with `clarify: !result.skipClarify`, eliminating silent breakage from natural language variants

### Changed
- Agents Manager single-agent and saved-chain launches default to quick run (skip clarify TUI) — the user already reviewed config in the overlay. Multi-agent ad-hoc chains default to showing the clarify TUI so users can configure per-step tasks, models, output files, and skills before execution. Toggle with `Tab` in the task-input screen.
- Extracted `applyThinkingSuffix(model, thinking)` helper from inline logic in `execution.ts`, shared with `async-execution.ts`
- Text editor: added word navigation (Alt+Left/Right, Ctrl+Left/Right), word delete (Alt+Backspace), paste support
- Agent discovery (`agents.ts`): loads `.chain.md` files via `loadChainsFromDir`, exposes `discoverAgentsAll` for overlay

## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-02

### Added
- **MCP direct tools for subagents** - Agents can request specific MCP tools as first-class tools via `mcp:` prefix in frontmatter: `tools: read, bash, mcp:chrome-devtools` or `tools: read, bash, mcp:github/search_repositories`. Requires pi-mcp-adapter.
- **`MCP_DIRECT_TOOLS` env var** - Subagent processes receive their direct tool config via environment variable. Agents without `mcp:` items get a `__none__` sentinel to prevent config leaking from the parent process.

## [0.5.3] - 2026-02-01

### Fixed
- Adapt execute signatures to pi v0.51.0: reorder signal, onUpdate, ctx parameters for subagent tool; add missing parameters to subagent_status tool

## [0.5.2] - 2026-01-28

### Improved
- **README: Added agent file locations** - New "Agents" section near top of README clearly documents:
  - User agents: `~/.pi/agent/agents/{name}.md`
  - Project agents: `.pi/agents/{name}.md` (searches up directory tree)
  - `agentScope` parameter explanation (`"user"`, `"project"`, `"both"`)
  - Complete frontmatter example with all fields
  - Note about system prompt being the markdown body after frontmatter

## [0.5.1] - 2026-01-27

### Fixed
- Google API compatibility: Use `Type.Any()` for mixed-type unions (`SkillOverride`, `output`, `reads`, `ChainItem`) to avoid unsupported `anyOf`/`const` JSON Schema patterns

## [0.5.0] - 2026-01-27

### Added
- **Skill support** - Agents can declare skills in frontmatter that get injected into system prompts
  - Agent frontmatter: `skill: tmux, chrome-devtools` (comma-separated)
  - Runtime override: `skill: "name"` or `skill: false` to disable all skills
  - Chain-level skills additive to agent skills, step-level override supported
  - Skills injected as XML: `<skill name="...">content</skill>` after agent system prompt
  - Missing skills warn but continue execution (warning shown in result summary)
- **TUI skill selector** - Press `[s]` to browse and select skills for any step
  - Multi-select with space bar
  - Fuzzy search by name or description
  - Shows skill source (project/user) and description
  - Project skills (`.pi/skills/`) override user skills (`~/.pi/agent/skills/`)
- **Skill display** - Skills shown in TUI, progress tracking, summary, artifacts, and async status
- **Parallel task skills** - Each parallel task can specify its own skills via `skill` parameter

### Fixed
- **Chain summary formatting** - Fixed extra blank line when no skills are present
- **Duplicate skill deduplication** - `skill: "foo,foo"` now correctly deduplicates to `["foo"]`
- **Consistent skill tracking in async mode** - Both chain and single modes now track only resolved skills

## [0.4.1] - 2026-01-26

### Changed
- Added `pi-package` keyword for npm discoverability (pi v0.50.0 package system)

## [0.4.0] - 2026-01-25

### Added
- **Clarify TUI for single and parallel modes** - Use `clarify: true` to preview/edit before execution
  - Single mode: Edit task, model, thinking level, output file
  - Parallel mode: Edit each task independently, model, thinking level
  - Navigate between parallel tasks with ↑↓
- **Mode-aware TUI headers** - Header shows "Agent: X" for single, "Parallel Tasks (N)" for parallel, "Chain: X → Y" for chains
- **Model override for single/parallel** - TUI model selection now works for all modes

### Fixed
- **MAX_PARALLEL error mode** - Now correctly returns `mode: 'parallel'` (was incorrectly `mode: 'single'`)
- **`output: true` handling** - Now correctly treats `true` as "use agent's default output" instead of creating a file literally named "true"

### Changed
- **Schema description** - `clarify` parameter now documents all modes: "default: true for chains, false for single/parallel"

## [0.3.3] - 2026-01-25

### Added
- **Thinking level selector in chain TUI** - Press `[t]` to set thinking level for any step
  - Options: off, minimal, low, medium, high, xhigh (ultrathink)
  - Appends to model as suffix (e.g., `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5:high`)
  - Pre-selects current thinking level if already set
- **Model selector in chain TUI** - Press `[m]` to select a different model for any step
  - Fuzzy search through all available models
  - Shows current model with ✓ indicator
  - Provider/model format (e.g., `anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5`)
  - Override indicator (✎) when model differs from agent default
- **Model visibility in chain execution** - Shows which model each step is using
  - Display format: `Step 1: scout (claude-haiku-4-5) | 3 tools, 16.8s`
  - Model shown in both running and completed steps
- **Auto-propagate output changes to reads** - When you change a step's output filename,
  downstream steps that read from it are automatically updated to use the new filename
  - Maintains chain dependencies without manual updates
  - Example: Change scout's output from `context.md` to `summary.md`, planner's reads updates automatically

### Changed
- **Progress is now chain-level** - `[p]` toggles progress for ALL steps at once
  - Progress setting shown at chain level (not per-step)
  - Chains share a single progress.md, so chain-wide toggle is more intuitive
- **Clearer output/writes labeling** - Renamed `output:` to `writes:` to clarify it's a file
  - Hotkey changed from `[o]` to `[w]` for consistency
- **{previous} data flow indicator** - Shows on the PRODUCING step (not receiving):
  - `↳ response → {previous}` appears after scout's reads line
  - Only shows when next step's template uses `{previous}`
  - Clearer mental model: output flows DOWN the chain
- Chain TUI footer updated: `[e]dit [m]odel [t]hinking [w]rites [r]eads [p]rogress`

### Fixed
- **Chain READ/WRITE instructions now prepended** - Instructions restructured:
  - `[Read from: /path/file.md]` and `[Write to: /path/file.md]` prepended BEFORE task
  - Overrides any hardcoded filenames in task text from parent agent
  - Previously: instructions were appended at end and could be overlooked
- **Output file validation** - After each step, validates expected file was created:
  - If missing, warns: "Agent wrote to different file(s): X instead of Y"
  - Helps diagnose when agents don't create expected outputs
- **Root cause: agents need `write` tool** - Agents without `write` in their tools list
  cannot create output files (they tried MCP workarounds which failed)
- **Thinking level suffixes now preserved** - Models with thinking levels (e.g., `claude-sonnet-4-5:high`)
  now correctly resolve to `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5:high` instead of losing the provider prefix

### Improved
- **Per-step progress indicators** - When progress is enabled, each step shows its role:
  - Step 1: `● creates & updates progress.md`
  - Step 2+: `↔ reads & updates progress.md`
  - Clear visualization of progress.md data flow through the chain
- **Comprehensive tool descriptions** - Better documentation of chain variables:
  - Tool description now explains `{task}`, `{previous}`, `{chain_dir}` in detail
  - Schema descriptions clarify what each variable means and when to use them
  - Helps agents construct proper chain queries for any use case

## [0.3.2] - 2026-01-25

### Performance
- **4x faster polling** - Reduced poll interval from 1000ms to 250ms (efficient with mtime caching)
- **Mtime-based caching** - status.json and output tail reads cached to avoid redundant I/O
- **Unified throttled updates** - All onUpdate calls consolidated under 50ms throttle
- **Widget change detection** - Hash-based change detection skips no-op re-renders
- **Array optimizations** - Use concat instead of spread for chain progress updates

### Fixed
- **Timer leaks** - Track and clear pendingTimer and cleanupTimers properly
- **Updates after close** - processClosed flag prevents updates after process terminates  
- **Session cleanup** - Clear cleanup timers on session_start/switch/branch/shutdown

## [0.3.1] - 2026-01-24

### Changed
- **Major code refactor** - Split monolithic index.ts into focused modules:
  - `execution.ts` - Core runSync function for single agent execution
  - `chain-execution.ts` - Chain orchestration (sequential + parallel steps)
  - `async-execution.ts` - Async/background execution support
  - `render.ts` - TUI rendering (widget, tool result display)
  - `schemas.ts` - TypeBox parameter schemas
  - `formatters.ts` - Output formatting utilities
  - `utils.ts` - Shared utility functions
  - `types.ts` - Shared type definitions and constants

### Fixed
- **Expanded view visibility** - Running chains now properly show:
  - Task preview (truncated to 80 chars) for each step
  - Recent tools fallback when between tool calls
  - Increased recent output from 2 to 3 lines
- **Progress matching** - Added agent name fallback when index doesn't match
- **Type safety** - Added defensive `?? []` for `recentOutput` access on union types

## [0.3.0] - 2026-01-24

### Added
- **Full edit mode for chain TUI** - Press `e`, `o`, or `r` to enter a full-screen editor with:
  - Word wrapping for long text that spans multiple display lines
  - Scrolling viewport (12 lines visible) with scroll indicators (↑↓)
  - Full cursor navigation: Up/Down move by display line, Page Up/Down by viewport
  - Home/End go to start/end of current display line, Ctrl+Home/End for start/end of text
  - Auto-scroll to keep cursor visible
  - Esc saves, Ctrl+C discards changes

### Improved
- **Tool description now explicitly shows the three modes** (SINGLE, CHAIN, PARALLEL) with syntax - helps agents pick the right mode when user says "scout → planner"
- **Chain execution observability** - Now shows:
  - Chain visualization with status icons: `✓scout → ●planner` (✓=done, ●=running, ○=pending, ✗=failed) - sequential chains only
  - Accurate step counter: "step 1/2" instead of misleading "1/1"
  - Current tool and recent output for running step

## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-24

### Changed
- **Rebranded to `pi-subagents`** (was `pi-async-subagents`)
- Now installable via `npx pi-subagents`

### Added
- Chain TUI now supports editing output paths, reads lists, and toggling progress per step
- New keybindings: `o` (output), `r` (reads), `p` (progress toggle)
- Output and reads support full file paths, not just relative to chain_dir
- Each step shows all editable fields: task, output, reads, progress

### Fixed
- Chain clarification TUI edit mode now properly re-renders after state changes (was unresponsive)
- Changed edit shortcut from Tab to 'e' (Tab can be problematic in terminals)
- Edit mode cursor now starts at beginning of first line for better UX
- Footer shows context-sensitive keybinding hints for navigation vs edit mode
- Edit mode is now single-line only (Enter disabled) - UI only displays first line, so multi-line was confusing
- Added Ctrl+C in edit mode to discard changes (Esc saves, Ctrl+C discards)
- Footer now shows "Done" instead of "Save" for clarity
- Absolute paths for output/reads now work correctly (were incorrectly prepended with chainDir)

### Added
- Parallel-in-chain execution with `{ parallel: [...] }` step syntax for fan-out/fan-in patterns
- Configurable concurrency and fail-fast options for parallel steps
- Output aggregation with clear separators (`=== Parallel Task N (agent) ===`) for `{previous}`
- Namespaced artifact directories for parallel tasks (`parallel-{step}/{index}-{agent}/`)
- Pre-created progress.md for parallel steps to avoid race conditions

### Changed
- TUI clarification skipped for chains with parallel steps (runs directly in sync mode)
- Async mode rejects chains with parallel steps with clear error message
- Chain completion now returns summary blurb with progress.md and artifacts paths instead of raw output

### Added
- Live progress display for sync subagents (single and chain modes)
- Shows current tool, recent output lines, token count, and duration during execution
- Ctrl+O hint during sync execution to expand full streaming view
- Throttled updates (150ms) for smoother progress display
- Updates on tool_execution_start/end events for more responsive feedback

### Fixed
- Async widget elapsed time now freezes when job completes instead of continuing to count up
- Progress data now correctly linked to results during execution (was showing "ok" instead of "...")

### Added
- Extension API support (registerTool) with `subagent` tool name
- Session logs (JSONL + HTML export) and optional share links via GitHub Gist
- `share` and `sessionDir` parameters for session retention control
- Async events: `subagent:started`/`subagent:complete` (legacy events still emitted)
- Share info surfaced in TUI and async notifications
- Async observability folder with `status.json`, `events.jsonl`, and `subagent-log-*.md`
- `subagent_status` tool for inspecting async run state
- Async TUI widget for background runs

### Changed
- Parallel mode auto-downgrades to sync when async:true is passed (with note in output)
- TUI now shows "parallel (no live progress)" label to set expectations
- Tools passed via agent config can include extension paths (forwarded via `--extension`)

### Fixed
- Chain mode now sums step durations instead of taking max (was showing incorrect total time)
- Async notifications no longer leak across pi sessions in different directories

## [0.1.0] - 2026-01-03

Initial release forked from async-subagent example.

### Added
- Output truncation with configurable byte/line limits
- Real-time progress tracking (tools, tokens, duration)
- Debug artifacts (input, output, JSONL, metadata)
- Session-tied artifact storage for sync mode
- Per-step duration tracking for chains
